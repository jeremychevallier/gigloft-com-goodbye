        When weâ€™re first starting off, weâ€™re usually focused on just getting some kind of paid gig. We measure our success by our ability to get the first gig, and then the second, and then the third. These baby steps are crucial to <a href="https://blog.gigloft.com/success-isnt-monetary-its-a-feeling/" target="_blank">feeling successful</a>, so how can we get started on them today?
      </p>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        Here are the things you need in order to break into freelancing.
      </p>
      <h3 class="px-7 pt-4">ðŸ’° Some kind of existing <span class="semib text-green">income or savings</span></h3>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        Building up freelance income takes time, and life is expensive! You should have some kind of job or other situation bringing in income, or a reliable spouse/savings account ðŸ˜Š This ensures that the issue of money is off the table, which allows you to focus entirely on building your portfolio and sales pipeline.
      </p>

      <h3 class="px-7 pt-4">ðŸ’¸ <span class="semib text-purple">A willingness to spend money</span> to make money</h3>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        When weâ€™re intentional about how we spend our money, weâ€™re really investing. This helps curb the anxiety that can come with having to spend money to make money.
      </p>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        Examples of things worth investing in:
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>
            Lead generation (like paid listings on some niche marketplaces)
          </li>
          <li>
            Tools that save you time (which gives you more opportunity to earn)
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>People</i> who can save you time and do things better than you
          </li>
          <li>
            Tools that save you money (like <a href="https://catch.co/gigloft" target="_blank">Catch</a>, that helps you save for retirement)
          </li>
          <li>
            Experiences that enrich your life and decrease stress, like yoga classes, vacations, and simple trips to the park and restaurant with your family or friends. Life is happening; donâ€™t forget to enjoy it all. ðŸ˜Š
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        This becomes more clear when we realize that how we spend our money, time, and attention is actually an investment into the people we want to be now and later in life.
