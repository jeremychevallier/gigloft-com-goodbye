        When we’re first starting off, we’re usually focused on just getting some kind of paid gig. We measure our success by our ability to get the first gig, and then the second, and then the third. These baby steps are crucial to <a href="https://blog.gigloft.com/success-isnt-monetary-its-a-feeling/" target="_blank">feeling successful</a>, so how can we get started on them today?
      </p>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        Here are the things you need in order to break into freelancing.
      </p>
      <h3 class="px-7 pt-4">💰 Some kind of existing <span class="semib text-green">income or savings</span></h3>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        Building up freelance income takes time, and life is expensive! You should have some kind of job or other situation bringing in income, or a reliable spouse/savings account 😊 This ensures that the issue of money is off the table, which allows you to focus entirely on building your portfolio and sales pipeline.
      </p>

      <h3 class="px-7 pt-4">💸 <span class="semib text-purple">A willingness to spend money</span> to make money</h3>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        When we’re intentional about how we spend our money, we’re really investing. This helps curb the anxiety that can come with having to spend money to make money.
      </p>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        Examples of things worth investing in:
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>
            Lead generation (like paid listings on some niche marketplaces)
          </li>
          <li>
            Tools that save you time (which gives you more opportunity to earn)
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>People</i> who can save you time and do things better than you
          </li>
          <li>
            Tools that save you money (like <a href="https://catch.co/gigloft" target="_blank">Catch</a>, that helps you save for retirement)
          </li>
          <li>
            Experiences that enrich your life and decrease stress, like yoga classes, vacations, and simple trips to the park and restaurant with your family or friends. Life is happening; don’t forget to enjoy it all. 😊
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        This becomes more clear when we realize that how we spend our money, time, and attention is actually an investment into the people we want to be now and later in life.

      <p class="px-7 lead">
        When we don’t have any visible proof of our quality of work, it’s really hard for people to trust us. Clients also like to make decisions by themselves or with their team, without you in the conversation.
      </p>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        When we’re first starting off, our work isn’t always the best. We know what good work looks like, and we know we’re not quite where we want to be. This is a good thing! Listen to Ira Glass explain why this “gap” exists, and how you can push past it:
      </p>
      <p class="lead">

      </p>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        So how do we earn trust? Break through the gap?
      </p>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        Like Ira Glass says: by going through a large volume of work.

      <p class="px-7 lead">
        Building a portfolio is the second-most effective way to get hired for new gigs. Why? It proves to potential clients that you’re not only able to do the work, but great at it, too.

      </p>
      <p class="quote quote-purple px-5 lead">
        I’ve come to learn that it’s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but <i>periods of repeatable habits.</i>
      </p>
      <p class="quote quote-pink px-5 lead">
        How to be great? Just be good, <i>repeatably.</i>
      </p>
      <p class="px-7 lead">
        Just be good. Repeatably. The entire article is about the “one step at a time” philosophy to getting better at things.
      </p>
      <p class="quote quote-pink px-5 lead">
        So if you’re still asking the question, “How do I become great in life?”, I would ask you to reframe the question as “How do I become good in life” or even “How do I become decent” and focus on developing those habits to repeat over time. Transform these habits to be your baseline.
