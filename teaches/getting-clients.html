          If you understand this dynamic, you can sell anything. As a freelancer, you will always have something to sell: your skills and style!
        </p>
        <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
          Your goal is to sell without your prospects ever thinking about it. How to do this? Start by mentally replacing the concept of ‚Äúselling‚Äú with the idea of ‚Äúhelping.‚Äù Focus on providing as much value as you can into the world. In turn, the world has a funny way of returning the favor.
        </p>

          No more going to networking events with your business card extended out in front of you. No more cold emailing asking if someone wants your services. No more direct selling! You‚Äôre now learning how to provide value, and how to capture value in return.

          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garyvaynerchuk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> spends most of his time giving value, not selling. He does this to position himself, so when he does have an opportunity to ‚Äúsell‚Äù something, it doesn‚Äôt come off salesy because he‚Äôs been giving‚Äîhe‚Äôs been building rapport and authenticity.
        </p>
        <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
          His book about this method, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17383989-jab-jab-jab-right-hook" target="_blank">Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</a>, compares sales to boxing: a pro boxer doesn‚Äôt climb into the ring and throw a right hook immediately. He starts by getting a feel for his opponent, and delivering small jabs that steadily reduce the foe‚Äôs resistance.
        </p>
        <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
          That same philosophy applies in business. The idea here is that, if you go into a sale looking to sell, you‚Äôve already lost. ‚ÄúJabbing‚Äù as a freelancer means helping; it means giving value.

          As Gary Vee explains, when your energy is focused on disproportionally providing value, you will win. So what are some ways you can do that?

          You might think these kinds of things deserve a price tag, and you could be right‚Äîbut this is 2019, and people do business differently in 2019. It‚Äôs about trust and relationships, and the best way to build that is by providing massive value and asking nothing in return. Growing your trust first builds your clout far faster than going around trying to bag a quick client. Remember, this is just the foundation.
        </p>
        <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
          You need to jab a few times before you go in for the killer right hook‚Äîthe ask you want to make: ‚ÄúHire me to be your ______.‚Äù If you‚Äôve been helpful, if you‚Äôve built rapport and a relationship with someone, you‚Äôre far more likely to ‚Äúland the right hook.‚Äù

          <a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/the-one-thing-i-didnt-clarify-enough-in-jab-jab-jab-right-hook/" target="_blank">In Gary Vee‚Äôs own words</a>, the JJJRH method from your childhood:
        </p>
        <p class="quote quote-purple px-5 lead">
          My favorite analogy to illustrate the difference between jabs and right hooks are cartoons. When the Transformers cartoon was on Saturday mornings, you would tune in and watch for free. You‚Äôd watch the cartoons and not have to pay a dime. But when the movie or new action figure or toy came out, you went and paid for that. Cartoons were the jabs that pulled you in so you would then pay for the movie or toy.
        </p>
        <h2 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">So, when do you throw a right hook?</h2>
        <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
          The best time to throw a right hook is when someone gives you permission to. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seth-godin-7bab7a135/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seth Godin</a> coined the term ‚Äú<a href="https://seths.blog/2008/01/permission-mark/" target="_blank">permission marketing</a>‚Äù beautifully:
        </p>
        <p class="quote quote-green px-5 lead">
          Permission marketing is the privilege (not the right) of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who actually want to get them.
        </p>
        <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
          You‚Äôve been so helpful to them that they want to hire you when it‚Äôs time to hire a freelance writer, designer, etc. Of course, this doesn‚Äôt mean everyone you help will come flocking. More realistically, you‚Äôll need to stay top-of-mind and be confident in making a strong ask that ‚Äúlands‚Äù properly.

          Remember: the reason you can make this ask is because you‚Äôve been building your clout and goodwill for the last several months, and these people, in a way, feel like they owe you something. Some will click the link for that very reason. Playing the long game works in sales. Patience can be hard to keep up, but patience pays.

            Because <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/" target="_blank">over 2.65 billion people have online profiles</a> these days, it‚Äôs pretty likely that the types of clients you want will be listed <i>somewhere</i>. The important thing is to know how.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            There are countless tools and tricks for finding people online and in real life. Of course, any smart freelancer‚Äôs goal is to find <i>specific</i> people, which requires defining your client persona(s). Doing that well includes making an educated guess about where those kinds of people spend time online and in the real world.

            Once you have a solid hypothesis for where to find your potential new clients, it‚Äôs time to gather your tools and techniques for finding them. You can find potential clients in several ways:

          <h2 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Learn the art of <span class="text-blue">social selling</span></h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            The concept behind social selling is nothing new. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinanewberry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Christina Newberry</a> defined it this way for the Hootsuite blog:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-green px-5 lead">
            Social selling is the art of using social media to find, connect with, understand, and nurture sales prospects. <b>It‚Äôs the modern way to develop meaningful relationships with potential customers</b> so you‚Äôre the first person or brand a prospect thinks of when they‚Äôre ready to buy.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            As you can see, the only new thing about social selling is where it takes place: on social media. The idea is that, since you and everyone else already have social profiles on many platforms, you might as well use them to your advantage.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            When we put ourselves out there by posting regularly‚Äîand, equally importantly, engaging on others‚Äô content‚Äîwe start to become part of the conversation in more ways than one.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            For one, other people begin to notice us, begin to remember our name and face. But there‚Äôs another important factor playing to your advantage when you engage online: the platforms‚Äô algorithms.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mosseri/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adam Mosseri</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/" target="_blank">own words</a> from 2018, this is how Facebook thinks about content:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-blue px-5 lead">
            Today we use signals like how many people react to, comment on or share posts to determine how high they appear in News Feed.
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-blue px-5 lead">
            With this update, we will also prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people.
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-blue px-5 lead">
            These are posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs a post from a friend seeking advice, a friend asking for recommendations for a trip, or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            While each platform‚Äôs algorithms are unique, they share one important, common goal: learning to prioritize the content and content creators it deems are most valuable to its users. Therefore, your job is to be valuable. On social media, that means posting meaningful updates (not just the stuff you think will get the most likes), leaving insightful comments on others‚Äô¬†posts, and having 1-to-1 conversations in private messages.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            You‚Äôll notice that the people you engage with most will begin to appear more often in your feed. They‚Äôll also be more likely to see your content in their feed‚Äîwhich keeps you top of mind, a key result in your <a href="/teaches/personal-branding" target="_blank">personal branding efforts</a>.

          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            These major social media platforms are built to let people find and connect with each other. Any resourceful freelancer can easily do some advanced searching to find specific people, or specific kinds of people (like those with a certain job title, or who live in a certain location).

            In my network alone, that‚Äôs 3,582 people, 229 of whom live here in the Phoenix, AZ area near me. Talk about a powerful search, right?

            Facebook and Instagram prove more difficult to find specific kinds of people without running paid advertising.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Instead, Facebook Groups are a gold mine of connections, and you should seek to join as many groups as are relevant to your interests! Keep in mind that the goal of joining groups is never to outwardly sell‚Äîyou are building meaningful connections with people who share your interests, and if you‚Äôre strategic and skilled, you will earn business from these connections at some point. But play the long game.

            Finally, Twitter is a great place to find real-time conversations around specific topics and hashtags. At GigLoft, one of the big ways we try to help aspiring freelancers is by searching terms like ‚Äútried to freelance‚Äù¬†on Twitter, and engaging with people who have recently Tweeted things like ‚ÄúI tried to freelance last year but it didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù We engage with the person from our personal accounts, find out what didn‚Äôt work, and send them a link to one of our guide pages (like this one you‚Äôre on right now).
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Think about the kinds of things your ideal clients might be discussing on Twitter. It might be directly related to what you do, like ‚Äú<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22looking%20for%20a%20writer%22&src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">looking for a writer</a>,‚Äù or it might be completely unrelated to what you do. Your job is to think critically about who you want to reach out to, by trying random search terms, learning from what people are Tweeting, and narrowing down from there.

          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            At PubLoft, we used <a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/products/crunchbase-pro/?ref=GigLoft" target="_blank">Crunchbase Pro</a> to discover long lists of companies based on various combinations of search filters, one of which we‚Äôll share with you here:

          <img width="100%" class="pb-4 maxw-500 d-flex mx-auto" src="../assets/img/crunchbase-filters.png" alt="crunchbase pro advanced targeting filters to find freelance customers"/>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            This specific set of criteria was especially useful for several reasons. For one, we wanted to make sure we were working exclusively with American companies in the ‚Äúdirect to consumer‚Äù (D2C) space‚Äîbrands like Dollar Shave Club, ScentBox, and Tuft & Needle. That‚Äôs because we learned that D2C companies have to be very careful with how much they spend on customer acquisition costs (CAC), so they‚Äôre likely to invest in long-term strategies that cost little to nothing once they start working‚Äîchannels like organic search ranking, possible with search engine optimization (SEO).
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            We also chose to work with companies that had raised enough money recently enough to be able to invest in content marketing, our main hustle. Finally, the smaller the team, the more likely they had funds to allocate and a dire need to outsource certain activities, like content creation.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            This group of filters was just one of many we used, and we made sure we had a highly specific message for each type of company. Remember‚Äîthe more personalized you are in your approach, the more people will feel that you‚Äôre a real human trying to build a real relationship, and the more success you‚Äôll see.

        <div id="with-google">
          <h2 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Finding clients with Google</h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Naturally, Google is one of the most powerful ways to find anything and anyone online‚Äîwhen you know how to use it. Here‚Äôs a quick primer on some basic Google-fu that you can use to narrow down your searches.
          </p>
          <h4 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Searching specific websites</h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Google lets us search specific sites‚Äô public content simply by typing <span class="text-code">site:linkedin.com SEARCH TERM</span>. This is often a better way to find content or profiles than the site‚Äôs own search function, since Google has arguably the best search known to humankind. üò±
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            We can repeat this kind of search inside of website subdirectories, too. Searching <span class="text-code">site:gigloft.com freelance</span> will return every instance of the word ‚Äúfreelance‚Äù on our website, but <span class="text-code">site:gigloft.com/teaches/ freelance</span> will return <i>only</i> the instances of ‚Äúfreelance‚Äù on URLs that contain ‚Äúgigloft.com/teaches/‚Äù. (Meaning our freelance guides, like this one!)
          </p>
          <h4 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Excluding search terms</h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Googling the term <span class="text-code">marketing director phoenix</span> is a good way to return pages that must contain both ‚Äúmarketing director‚Äù and ‚ÄúPhoenix,‚Äù but we mostly get job listings and salary data:
          </p>
          <img width="100%" class="pb-4 maxw-500 d-flex mx-auto" src="../assets/img/google-serp-marketing-directors-phoenix-jobs.png" alt="google search to find marketing directors in phoenix but returns jobs instead"/>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Adding <span class="text-code">-job</span> to the end of your search, we can filter out most of the job stuff to leave only profiles or pages talking about marketing directors in the Phoenix area (below the paid job listings):
          </p>
          <img width="100%" class="pb-4 maxw-500 d-flex mx-auto" src="../assets/img/google-serp-marketing-directors-phoenix-not-jobs.png" alt="google search to find marketing directors in phoenix with correct exclusion filter"/>
          <h4 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Requiring specific words or phrases</h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            We can use quotes around terms to make sure those words are included. For example, the search <span class="text-code">some random search term</span> returns a bunch of random results that sort of match the words ‚Äúrandom‚Äù and ‚Äúsearch‚Äù or ‚Äúterm.‚Äù
          </p>
          <img width="100%" class="pb-4 maxw-500 d-flex mx-auto" src="../assets/img/google-random-search-no-quotes.png" alt="google search without quotes returns many generalized results"/>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            But if (for whatever reason) you were looking for webpages that <i>exactly</i> matched that query, you‚Äôd use <span class="text-code">‚Äúsome random search term‚Äù</span> in quotes, and get results that contain that exact phrase:
          </p>
          <img width="100%" class="pb-4 maxw-500 d-flex mx-auto" src="../assets/img/google-random-search-in-quotes.png" alt="google search with quotes returns specific results"/>
          <h4 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Searching with AND / OR operators</h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            The AND operator is useful when you want to force-combine two terms that normally don‚Äôt go together. By now, Google has pretty much figured out that <span class="text-code">freelance cambodia</span> is the same query as <span class="text-code">freelance AND cambodia</span> so it‚Äôs rarely necessary to use AND anymore. Search either of these, and we get fairly similar results‚Äîjobs and freelancers located in Cambodia.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            The OR operator is still very useful‚Äîit returns <i>any</i> page that matches <i>either</i> ‚Äúfreelance‚Äù or ‚Äúcambodia‚Äù in whichever order those pages would rank normally. Search <span class="text-code">freelance OR cambodia</span> and we get Cambodia-specific websites, as well as freelancer.com at roughly result #5 at the time of this writing. These sites have nothing to do with each other, and this can be a useful trick when you want to compare search engine rankings of different pages that don‚Äôt normally go together. Try it if you‚Äôre curious!

          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            If you‚Äôre smart, you‚Äôll use email <i>in addition to</i> social, not instead of it. Business people live in our emails, sometimes to a fault, and a well-crafted, well-timed email can sometimes be the perfect way to get on someone‚Äôs radar to start a conversation. Remember, we‚Äôre always optimizing to start a conversation, rather than trying to get a client right off the bat. We must make it easy for them to respond, and let the conversation develop naturally.
          </p>
          <h4 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Tools to find email addresses</h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Of course, in order to reach out via email we‚Äôve got to find those email addresses. Tools like <a href="http://hunter.io/?ref=GigLoft" target="_blank">Hunter</a> let us find email addresses from websites extremely quickly, and even try to guess the address if it can‚Äôt find someone‚Äôs email specifically using the ‚Äúmost common pattern‚Äù logic:

          <img width="100%" class="pb-4" src="../assets/img/hunter-showing-crunchbase-email-addresses.png" alt="email hunter chrome extension showing email addresses"/>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Its results are not always perfect, of course, but they‚Äôre a great start to finding‚Äîor guessing‚Äîthe right person‚Äôs email address.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Another great tool is <a href="https://getprospect.io/?ref=GigLoft" target="_blank">GetProspect</a>, which works on LinkedIn and is free for the first 100 emails per month (at the time of this writing), plenty for a solo freelancer growing her client base.
          </p>
          <h4 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Tools to verify that email addresses won‚Äôt ‚Äúbounce‚Äù</h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            If we send too many emails that bounce, meaning didn‚Äôt have a valid recipient, our email addresses can get flagged as spam‚Äîand you do <i>not</i> want that. It basically ruins your privilege to send email.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Most hunting tools like Hunter also verify emails, but you can also use more specialized software like <a href="https://neverbounce.com/?ref=GigLoft" target="_blank">Neverbounce</a> to take advantage of additional features like list segmentation.
          </p>
          <h4 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Tools to send email efficiently</h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Once you‚Äôve got a list of verified emails, we first start by sending cold emails manually. Get a feel for the process of writing a cold email, and try to be personalized in your reach-outs. For busy business people, there‚Äôs nothing more eye-catching than receiving an email that speaks directly to us. If it drops a ton of value, even better.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Only when we‚Äôve learned which reach-outs work best can we begin to scale our outreach efforts with mass email senders like <a href="https://mailshake.com/?ref=GigLoft">Mailshake</a>. The most valuable feature for solo freelancers is the ability to schedule automatic follow-ups. This way, we don‚Äôt have to constantly follow up‚Ä¶¬†and follow up‚Ä¶¬†and follow up‚Äîwhich is crucial to success with email outreach. More on that below.

            Since the dawn of time, human beings have engaged in in-person interaction, and the core benefits remain just as true today as they were when we communicated with grunts and gestures only. Don‚Äôt let the Internet‚Äôs ease of access make you lazy: spend a significant portion of your time out of the house.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            There‚Äôs something about real life interactions that just takes the cake. You get to shake hands, feed off the other person‚Äôs energy and emotions in real-time, take advantage of nonverbal cues, and so much more. That‚Äôs because, as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauravanderkam/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Laura Vanderkam</a> explains, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3051518/the-science-of-when-you-need-in-person-communication" target="_blank">the science of in-person communication</a> goes back to our roots:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-pink px-5 lead">
            Human beings had little ability to communicate with those who weren‚Äôt physically close to them until the past century, and our brains don‚Äôt evolve as rapidly as technology.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            By taking advantage of the benefits of in-person interaction, we can have better interactions, conversations, and outcomes in our freelance careers.

          <h3 id="" class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Top places to find your ideal clients in real life</h4>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Again, the biggest thing to ask yourself in this case is, <i>who</i> are your ideal clients? Think critically about your audience, and come up with a list of interests and activities they enjoy. <i>Tip: start by listing your favorites, and perhaps your ideal clients share those interests.</i> üòâ
          </p>
          <h4 id="" class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Niche events</h4>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Look up niche events that your clients might attend, and attend them. You can meet tons of design leaders by going to Design Week, a UX design meetup, etc. You can meet motivated content managers and overwhelmed business owners trying to learn at marketing conferences. The more you know about your target client, the easier it will be to find them.
          </p>
          <h4 id="" class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Popular places to work remotely</h4>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
             More and more people work remotely. Look up the hottest coffee shops in your area, go work there, and be open to interaction‚Äîopportunities to meet the regulars. Make a list of every coworking space in your area, and try to get a free day pass to each one. Just remember that these are places where people are trying to work‚Äîtry to avoid interrupting or bothering them. Find organic opportunities to interact, like when someone is ordering coffee or looking for an outlet.
          </p>
          <h4 id="" class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Your own hangout spots</h4>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
             What do you do when you‚Äôre not at home? Enjoy rock climbing or lifting weights? Don‚Äôt just show up at the gym with your earbuds in and avoid eye contact. Again, find organic chances to talk with others. Learn their names. Become someone they say ‚Äúhello‚Äù to when they see you.
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-orange px-5 lead">
            Push yourself to spend time in various kinds of places and interact with the other people there (without interrupting or bothering, of course).
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
             With these various places to start, you‚Äôll begin learning which kinds of people spend time in each, and who is most receptive to new connections and conversations.

            This idea comes worded this way by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tybennett/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ty Bennett</a>, but has been true since the dawn of humanity.

          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Think of it as talking less, and listening more. Bennett explains it this way in his aptly named article <a href="https://tybennett.com/be-interested-not-interesting/" target="_blank">Be Interested, Not Interesting</a>:

            Influence comes from making it about others. When we are genuinely interested in someone else, they will love us for it.

          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            A superpower in life is being curious‚Äîasking lots of thoughtful questions. We should always be interested in others, and not just because it leaves positive impressions on the people we talk to.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            The reason this works is that people love talking about themselves. When you‚Äôre eager to learn and listen to others share their life story or elevator pitch, they‚Äôll leave the conversation feeling like you were very interesting. Something inside them may feel like they owe you.

          <h2 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Learn the art of social selling.</h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            The concept behind social selling is nothing new. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinanewberry/" target="_blank">Christina Newberry</a> defined it this way for the Hootsuite blog:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-green px-5 lead">
            Social selling is the art of using social media to find, connect with, understand, and nurture sales prospects. It‚Äôs the modern way to develop meaningful relationships with potential customers so you‚Äôre the first person or brand a prospect thinks of when they‚Äôre ready to buy.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            As you can see, the only new thing about social selling is where it takes place: on social media. The idea is that, since you and everyone else already have social profiles on many platforms, you might as well use them to your advantage.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            When we put ourselves out there by posting regularly‚Äîand, equally importantly, engaging on others‚Äô content‚Äîwe start to become part of the conversation in more ways than one.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mosseri/" target="_blank">Adam Mosseri</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/" target="_blank">own words</a>, this is how Facebook thinks about content:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-blue px-5 lead">
            Today we use signals like how many people react to, comment on or share posts to determine how high they appear in News Feed. <br /><br />With this update, we will also prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people. [‚Ä¶] These are posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs a post from a friend seeking advice, a friend asking for recommendations for a trip, or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            While each platform‚Äôs algorithms are unique, they share one important, common goal: learning to prioritize the content and content creators it deems are most valuable to its users. Therefore, your job is to be valuable. On social media, that means posting meaningful updates (not just the stuff you think will get the most likes), leaving insightful comments on others‚Äô¬†posts, and having 1-to-1 conversations in private messages.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            You‚Äôll notice that the people you engage with most will begin to appear more often in your feed. They‚Äôll also be more likely to see your content in their feed‚Äîwhich keeps you top of mind, a key result in the personal brand category.
          </p>

            If you‚Äôre doing lots of outreach and struggling to get a response, it might be because you‚Äôre coming off too eager; ‚Äúthirsty,‚Äù¬†as the kids say: too eager to get something, desperate.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Indeed, this is a <i>killer</i> for freelancers: when you come off too eager in your outreach process, it turns people off. Just like in dating, this happens because we wan‚Äôt what we can‚Äôt have, and things that come easily we tend to value lower.

            Many people don‚Äôt realize this, but the key to making sales isn‚Äôt in the initial outreach. It‚Äôs in the follow-up.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Almost every customer PubLoft ever got was from a follow-up email, sometimes even 6+ times. The ultimate question now is:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-red px-5 lead">
            Why is following up the killer activity, and not the initial reach out?
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            The reason to follow up is that your prospects are probably really busy, and didn‚Äôt plan on talking to you today. When a CEO or manager wakes up and starts their day, they usually plan it‚Äîand that plan does not include you. When you reach out on email or LinkedIn introducing yourself, they aren‚Äôt going to want to engage immediately.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Additionally, chances are you aren‚Äôt the only one sending outbound messages to them. Other freelancers and salespeople could be targeting them, so whenever she gets one of those messages, she immediately rejects them. So how do you break through this wall?
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Follow up! Most people don‚Äôt, so when you do, people notice. And they respond.

            Another example of the phenomenon is outlined in <a href="https://due.com/blog/follow-ups/" target="_blank">this short listicle</a> by Amanda Abella:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-pink px-5 lead">
            I recently got a lucrative writing deal after following up with a prospect for months. It‚Äôs not that they didn‚Äôt want to respond, it‚Äôs that they were up to their eyeballs in other projects and some things took a back seat. I‚Äôm pretty sure that the only reason I got the gig, and therefore increased my revenue, is because I was so consistent with following up.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            By now you hopefully understand the importance of following up. It‚Äôs about getting the attention of the person you‚Äôre targeting, sometimes which will take months. Remember, the downside of not following up is:

            In the beginning of this talk, CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylewhissel/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kyle Whissel</a> talks about how the San Diego chargers (and every other NFL team) trains thousands of hours a year, in all seasons, just to prepare for 16 games that last 2‚Äì4 hours. He suggests that the same methodology be applied to prospecting. Build out your tool belt so much that you know what to do in every situation.

            Just like the right guard for the Chargers knows what to do during a blitz or a stacked defense, you should know how to follow up based on the behaviors your prospect is exhibiting.

          <h2 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Things to think about when following up</h2>
          <h3 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Be persistent, but not¬†annoying</h3>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Following up is not annoying your prospects with a ‚Äújust following up here‚Äù 20 times in a row. Each follow-up should be a value add, and it shouldn't even feel like a follow-up to the prospect.
          </p>
          <h3 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Develop your¬†cadence</h3>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            The way you think about when you send your follow-up emails and how much time in between each one is what we call cadence. <a href="https://twitter.com/becca_matias?lang=en" target="_blank">Rebecca Matias</a> dives into <a href="https://www.callboxinc.com/lead-generation/5-winning-sales-cadence-examples-lessons-draw/" target="_blank">sales cadence examples and lessons</a>:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-green px-5 lead">
            A sales cadence is simply a timeline of sales activities and methods reps follow to engage leads. For example, if one of the starting points in your sales conversion funnel involves a lead filling out a form on your site, the steps you take in order to contact that prospect and get him to agree to a face-to-face meeting make up your sales cadence.
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-purple px-5 lead">
            In this case, the sales cadence tells you when and how to contact the lead after completing the form (e.g., email on day 1, call on day 2, send a follow-up message on day 3, etc.). Find out how you can generate leads for your business.)

            There are a ton of different cadences. All the CRMs and sales tools teach their own, but you‚Äôre going to need to pick the on that‚Äôs best for you, whether it‚Äôs more aggressive or more laid back (or somewhere in the kiddle).
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            The cadence from Close.io‚Äôs book, <i>The Follow Up Formula</i>, is a great example:

          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            There are hundreds of examples of cadences if you look them up online, but if you want some place to start, I‚Äôd start with this one.

            Sometimes, a simple bit of persistence or gratitude can change the whole outcome. Here‚Äôs a great example:

          <h3 class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-4">Remember to add value</h3>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            You always want to make sure that you‚Äôre adding value ion your follow-ups and you‚Äôre not just bumping an email you sent a few years ago. <a href="https://emilybauer.contently.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Emily Bauer</a> published some <a href="https://www.propellercrm.com/blog/sales-follow-up-email" target="_blank">examples of great follow ups</a> after you send the initial message. And here is one strategy HubSpot talks about:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-orange px-5 lead">
            In your follow-up email, send one or two relevant materials from your own company‚Äôs content, such as a long-form content resource or recent blog article that addresses a challenge that you think they might be experiencing. Make it clear that you‚Äôre available to speak about their goals and that you have expertise in specific areas that matter to them.‚Ää
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            At the end of the day, you need to pick the cadence that will work with you. We suggest testing and iterating on your cadence until you have one that feels right and yields great results. Some more places to find inspiration for cadences are this <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/7-tactics-following-without-annoying.html" target="_blank">LifeHack</a> article, and <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/pleasantly-persistent-5-rules-for-effectively-following-up" target="_blank">this Muse article</a>.

          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            If you‚Äôre sending dozens of messages a day, it‚Äôs going to be hard to remember to follow up with everyone. This is why you need a tool to help you set reminders for each contact. Usually, this is the job of a CRM.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            If you don‚Äôt have a CRM, we suggest you start with HubSpot's free version and get used to the CRM life and work up from there. They also have a free extension that you can install inside your Gmail which makes setting follow up reminders super easy.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Good things happen to those who follow up. To finish off the lesson, read <a href="https://medium.com/callmemat/the-journey-to-win-jason-calacanis-over-9e210e545960" target="_blank">this article</a> on how our cofounder Mat Sherman kept following up with an angel investor, all the way to winning an investment from him!

            1.5 years of hustling my ass off and staying persistent finally got me to a yes. Persistence is everything. Screw talent. Screw luck. If you‚Äôre persistent enough, you‚Äôll make your own luck and people 10x more talented than you will want to be part of that luck.
          </p>

          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 pt-6 lead">
            Congrats on getting a potential client interested! When it comes down to the money conversation, remember one thing:
          </p>
          <h2 class="px-5 px-md-7">Ô∏èYou‚Äôre not trying to <span class="text-red semib">sell</span> them on your service.</h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            If you‚Äôve done your job thus far, they‚Äôre already sold on the value. Now your job is to get them to actually close: pay you money and start the project.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            You will almost always get the first ‚Äúclose‚Äù (verbal confirmation) during an in-person or virtual meeting/phone call‚Äîvery very rarely by email or text, and only if you have a high level of trust and successful communication with the other person. At that point, remember: they haven‚Äôt closed yet! I‚Äôll say it again.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            A new client that has verbally confirmed is not closed yet. Closing means paying you money. So how do we get there?
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            You‚Äôre not trying to sell them on your service‚Äîif you‚Äôve done your job thus far, they‚Äôre already sold on the value. Now your job is to get them to actually close: pay you money and start the project.
          </p>
          <h2 class="px-5 px-md-7">Ô∏èFocus on how you‚Äôll <span class="semib text-blue">solve their problems</span></h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Having great sales calls is an art that you can control.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Think about the last time someone tried to sell you something. Perhaps it was a store associate trying to upsell a piece of clothing, a recruiter working hard to convince you to take a job, or a sales rep telling you all about their online platform and why you should spend money to be on it.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Great salespeople (and freelancers) turn boring, ‚Äúgoing nowhere‚Äù calls into exciting, motivating calls by asking good questions and gaining a deep understanding of the client‚Äôs needs and expectations. They also inject their warmth and personality into the experience, making it feel less transactional and more like a real relationship is developing‚Äîbecause, when you do this right, it is.
          </p>
          <h2 class="px-5 px-md-7">Ô∏èKnow when & how to <span class="text-pink semib">negotiate</span></h2>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Usually when someone is trying to negotiate pricing, it‚Äôs because they want to spend as little of their budget as is necessary. (Understandable, since we all love saving money.) Sometimes, however, it‚Äôs for another reason. It could purely be a game they like to play, or a lack of confidence in the results you‚Äòll produce.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Regardless, you‚Äôll want to know.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Seek to understand why they‚Äôre trying to pay less. Ask questions like:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-pink px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            ‚ÄúIs this above your current budget?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-blue px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            ‚ÄúWould it be helpful to break this up into a couple more installments?‚Äù¬†
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Ultimately, your job is to get them to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù¬†to something that you both are happy with‚Äîeven if that is a much smaller amount than you‚Äôd originally anticipated.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Deals only work sustainably if they‚Äôre win-win. This means neither person feels like they‚Äôre getting the ‚Äúshort end of the stick.‚Äù¬†You should feel like you‚Äôre earning a fair rate for the work you‚Äôre doing, and your client should feel like they‚Äôre getting fair work for their money. Be super honest with yourself and your client about this, and you will almost always leave conversations feeling good about yourself‚Äîeven when the deal didn‚Äôt work out.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            The philosophy here is that it‚Äôs better to walk away from a bad deal than to try to force it through. You don‚Äôt want to create resentment in your relationships‚Äîit‚Äôll only lead to constant revisions and dissatisfaction for everything you do.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Therefore, when you‚Äôre confident in the quality of work you deliver, be willing to take a smaller project and prove your worth. However, never negotiate your rates.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Instead of working for a lower rate, and undermining your value to the client, take this advice from <a href="https://yourrate.co" target="_blank">yourrate.co</a> by Mark Hendricks:
          </p>
          <p class="quote quote-purple px-5 lead">
            See how you can limit the project scope while still solving the problem.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            (You‚Äòll need to enter your own numbers to see this tip + others.)
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            In other words, if your client can‚Äôt spend as much as the project will cost, it‚Äôs completely fair to remove certain pieces of the project that aren‚Äôt immediately necessary to its end goal. Educate your client on how these changes will affect both budget and outcomes, and let them decide what‚Äôs best for them.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            If they need what you do and are convinced you‚Äòre the person to work with, they‚Äôll find a way to make something work.

          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Remember the lesson above on following up? Yeah, you‚Äôre still not off the hook. Even when a client gives you the verbal confirmation, the exciting ‚ÄúOkay, send me an invoice!‚Äù¬†keep in mind that you haven‚Äôt gotten paid, yet.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Your next step is to send an invoice that clearly itemizes costs (breaks down the amount by services rendered) and gives the client an easy way to pay online. I can‚Äôt stress this enough: if it‚Äôs your first time taking a payment online, test the invoice link yourself, and make sure it‚Äôs got a way to pay by card, bank account, or PayPal/etc. Otherwise you‚Äôre just asking for them to ghost you.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Then, once you‚Äôve sent the invoice, keep following up every 2-3 days until it‚Äôs been paid. Again‚Äîbusiness leaders are busy, and will often forget to pay invoices when the project isn‚Äôt absolutely burning a hole through their priorities. Also, if you‚Äôre not selling directly to the CEO of a smaller company, the budget may require approval from one or more additional people in the organization.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Keep sending gentle reminders with the link to the invoice. Ask if there‚Äôs anything holding them back from getting started. Make jokes, if that‚Äôs your personality. Keep things lighthearted and you won‚Äôt seem desperate for the money.
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            (Meanwhile, keep working your other leads. Never allow yourself to rely on a single client‚Äôs payment coming in. Assume they will take a long time to close.)
          </p>
          <p class="px-5 px-md-7 lead">
            Finally, once you‚Äôve received payment, message them as soon as possible with a ‚Äúthanks‚Äù¬†and an explanation of what happens next! Congratulations, you just got paid. üëèüòÉ
