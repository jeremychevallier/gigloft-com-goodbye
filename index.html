      <h1>GigLoft was an online ‚Äúmodern business‚Äù school for freelancers.</span></h1>
      <p class="h3 pt-5">
        We closed our doors in October 2019, having taught <span class="text-blue">over 3 dozen freelancers</span> to find & close their own clients <span class="text-pink">in just 3 months</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="h3 pt-5">
        GigLoft was born out of <a href="https://publoft.com?utm_source=GigLoft.com" target="_blank">PubLoft</a>, a productized content marketing service that we grew from $0 ‚Äì¬†$24,000 MRR in just 7 months, <a href="https://callmemat.substack.com/p/the-journey-to-win-jason-calacanis" target="_blank">earning pre-seed investment</a> from Jason Calacanis‚Äôs LAUNCH Accelerator the following year.
      </p>
      <p class="h3 pt-5">
        Though we did many things well, we ultimately suffered from split focus by trying to pursue GigLoft before fully hiring ourselves out of PubLoft. We learned many important lessons about business‚Äîincluding how easily relationships can be damaged by financial stress‚Äîand we‚Äôre super grateful to all our students, mentors, and hiring partners for believing in us along the way!
